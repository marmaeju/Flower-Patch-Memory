# Flower Patch Memory

## A Memory Game Of Flowers

The player will play the game by pairing two of the same flower to make a match. The game will have a level where the player will match 6 cards. Once the player completes all the matches the game will end and they will have the choice to either replay the level or to click the button/tab to play the other level.

## How To Get Started

The plan for the game (including how to get started) will be included below in the Trello Board
