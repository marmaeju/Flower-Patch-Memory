# Flower Patch Memory

## A Memory Game Of Flowers

The player will play the game by pairing two of the same flower to make a match. The game will include 2 levels. An easy level where the player will match 6 cards, and a normal level where the player will match 12 cards. Once the player completes all the matches the game will end and they will have the choice to either replay the level or to click the button/tab to play the other level.

## How To Get Started

The plan for the game (including how to get started) will be included below in the Trello Board
